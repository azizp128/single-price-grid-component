## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to align content & items to the center of the page using flexbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  place-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  place-items: center;
}
```
